# HTTP

Zilla offers support for the following HTTP bindings:

- [HTTP Proxy](#http-proxy)
- [HTTP Kafka Proxy](#http-kafka-proxy)
- [HTTP Filesystem](#http-filesystem)

Each binding serves a distinct purpose, enabling seamless integration, routing, and management of HTTP-based interactions.

## [HTTP Proxy](./http.md)

Zilla's HTTP Proxy acts as an intermediary by managing, routing, and validating traffic between clients and backend services.

### Key Capabilities:

- Authentication.
- Advanced Request Routing.
- Schema Validation.

### Use Cases:

- API Gateway: Acts as a centralized entry point for managing and routing API requests to other services.

## [HTTP Kafka Proxy](./kafka.md)

The HTTP Kafka Proxy enables REST APIs to interact with Kafka's event-driven architecture, simplifying the integration between HTTP clients and Kafka systems.

### Key Capabilities:

- REST-to-Kafka Mapping: Translates REST API calls into Kafka messages.
- Correlated Request-Response: Ensures message consistency and traceability.
- Message Filtering: Filters Kafka messages for targeted delivery.
- Idempotency: Guarantees no duplicate processing of messages.
- Caching: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- AsyncAPI Specification Support.

### Use Cases:

- Building event-driven REST APIs.
- Simplifying integration between HTTP and Kafka services.
- Delivering Kafka messages to large-scale consumer groups.

## [HTTP Filesystem](./filesystem.md)

The HTTP Filesystem binding transforms Zilla into a versatile web server, enabling file serving and management directly from the filesystem. Itâ€™s ideal for scenarios requiring lightweight, configurable file hosting.

### Key Capabilities:

- Configurable File Routing: Customizable paths for serving files.
- Static File Serving: Efficiently delivers static content.
- Filesystem operations support.
