# stdout

The stdout exporter in Zilla logs telemetry events to the application's standard output (`stdout`), making them easily accessible for debugging. These logs can also be collected by external log aggregation systems for further analysis.

```yaml {3}
<!-- @include: ./.partials/stdout.yaml -->
```
