# Metrics

Zilla provides metrics for each protocol that is going through Zilla.

The metrics are categorized as the following:

- [Stream](stream.md)
- [HTTP](http.md)
- [gRPC](grpc.md)

Each category has its own metrics types. The metrics can be collected and exported via exporters, such as Prometheus.
