# Collect Diagnostic

The [zilla dump](/reference/config/zilla-cli.md#zilla-dump) command will capture all of the internal events at the stream level for a detailed analysis of what zilla was doing. These logs are captured down to the nanosecond and are exported as a `.pcap` file to be used with [Wireshark](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures). You can find instructions on how to view the capture in wireshark in the zilla dump [plugin install section](/reference/config/zilla-cli.md#i-install-plugin-directory).
