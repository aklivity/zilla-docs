# Zilla Runtime Configuration

The Zilla runtime configuration defines the `bindings`, `guards` and `vaults` used by the Zilla runtime engine. The values of properties in the configuration can be literals or expressions of the form `${{env.VARIABLE}}` to resolve a local environment variable value instead.
