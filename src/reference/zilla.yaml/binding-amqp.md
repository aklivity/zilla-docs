# amqp Binding ðŸš§

Zilla runtime amqp binding (incubator)

```yaml {2}
amqp_server0:
  type: amqp
  kind: server
  routes:
  - when:
    - address: echo
      capabilities: send_and_receive
    exit: echo_server0
```

Defines a binding with `amqp 1.0` protocol support, with `server` behavior.

The `server` kind `amqp` binding decodes `amqp 1.0` protocol on the inbound network stream, producing higher level application streams for each `send` or `receive` `link`.

Conditional routes based on the `link` `address` are used to route these application streams to an `exit` binding.

## Configuration

### kind\*
